# Introduction

---

This repository contains the user’s Neovim configuration files for use on Linux,
macOS, and Windows. The configurations were largely influenced by [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) and,
while the entire repository can be cloned, it’s recommended to instead
selectively copy desired parts and incorporate them into your own configuration,
as this repository is tailored to the user’s personal preferences.
